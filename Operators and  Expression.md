# OPERATORS
#### Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.
### Example :
```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int x = 100 + 50;
    System.out.println(x);
  }
}
```
#### Explaination: int x --> Result ; 100 --> Operand ; + --> Operator ; 50 --> Operand
