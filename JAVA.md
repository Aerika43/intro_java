### Explaination

#### Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class. In our example, we named the class Main. A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.

#### The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the filename.

#### Any code inside the main() method will be executed.

#### Each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).

- public =  this keyword is used so that we can access the class from anywhere.
- function = collection of code , functions are also known as Methods.
- void = void keyword specifies that a method should not have a return value.
- String[] args = means an array [] of sequence of characters ("String") that are passed to thr main function.
- System.out.print("Hello World");

  class   var   function/method  (standard output stream)
